  # Habitat Sartorial is the biggest project I've built

## The pitch
  I was approached by my good friend [Payne Vogtman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pvogtman/) to make a website for a nonprofit he was starting for $250 dollars. He wanted commerce functionality so that he could sell clothes on the website (the nonprofit's business model) as well as a blog in order to keep the followers aligned with the company vision. 
  
  Honestly $250 was quite the undershoot for what he was asking for. So I told him that I would do it for free if I could join as one of the founders and members of the board. To which he agreed!

  This happened in March of 2021. A summer later of coding marked the first collections "drop". We released the [Lookbook for Fall/Winter 2021 Classics](https://habitatsartorial.org/content/fw21-classics-lookbook) to drive excitement before dropping the [shop](https://habitatsartorial.org/shop/collections/fw21-classics) that allowed customers to purchase the designs. What that means is that I had to finish coding the blog and shop in a single summer.  

  This project was a stretch for me initially. I had experience coding in React for Curbside Health but had only ever setup backends either as a continuously running server in Python Flask or as serverless functions with NextJS in Python.
  
  ## Coding It Up
  
  I was still beginning in my career of Javascript and React, and so to get started I followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=377AQ0y6LPA) which brought Habitat Sartorial's website to become simply a one-page app that list random products:

  However, the tutorial used a backend wrapper to commerce websites called \`CommerceJS\` which would take 3% of all sales. I didn't want to lose this 3% lol so I wrote my own backend using firebase technologies.
